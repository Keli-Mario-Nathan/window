# Grading Notes

General
- Really nice job, y'all! Your end product is so well put together. It's fun to use and was super easy to understand how to use it!

CSS
- Looks good! There's a tiny bit of spacing inconsistencies, but other than that looks good. Nice job using sibling selectors and pseudo-classes.

JS
- Awesome job creating classes for your types of weather! On the flip side, the code working with the pane itself wasn't object oriented at all.
- See the files for any additional comments.

HTML
- See the files for detailed comments! Only a couple issues with indentation and your script tags.
