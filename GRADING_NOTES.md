# Grading Notes

General
- Really nice job, y'all! Your end product is so well put together. It's fun to use and was super easy to understand how to use it!

CSS
- Looks good! There's a tiny bit of spacing inconsistencies, but other than that looks good. Nice job using sibling selectors and pseudo-classes.
