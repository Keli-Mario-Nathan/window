Problem Statement:  Weather and nature (and lack therof) can have a profound effect on mood. However a window is now always
available and those that are available may not offer a pleasing view. Through *Pane Relief* we hope to provide visitors
with a convenient on-demand customizable portal with which they can view delightful and soothing scenes to reset their frame of mind.

Specfically we will build: 

 A website with three individual pages. All being interactive
 
 The landing page (index.html) is going to include a dropdown input with 3 options. There will also be a pop-up to provide visitors with context/background/instructions. 

index.html will show a link to saved.html if and only if localStorage determines they have previously visited.
 
The main attraction page (pane.html) is going to provide visitors with a window/canvas and numberous controls that they 
will use to create their own personal meditative scene. 
  
Pane.html will include sliders that will allow users to adjust the action within the pane and select a single value for the
properties described below
  
Pane.html will include a button to submit their setting to localStorage
 
The third page (saved.html) will collect and display a users previous pane and their settings. (pane name, last visit,)
 
Description of control panel on pane.html: 
    a.  "Main Category": Rain, Sun, Snow (preselected from index.html)
    b.  Speed, of elements
    c. Color, of elements
    d. Number, of elements
    e.  Size, of elements
    f. Color, of background (solid colors to begin with)
  
  Simple but necessary navigation guiding us to  index.html, pane.html, saved.html



Stretch Goals: 

1. "jquery range slider" on pane.html
2.  Instead of a single value user will be able to select the limits of a range and the actual values will be randomized within the range
3.  Hide control panel on pane.html
4. Include audio option/slider in control panel on pane.html
5.  Background color as a gradient
5. Background as an image
6.  On saved.html provide a way to edit previous visit data (delete, change description)
7.  On saved.html we will allow users to append notes
8.  Allow combinations of main weather elements
9.  Accept user interaction to affect directional movement
10. Incorporate real weather data
11. Add lightning because Keli wants to :-)
